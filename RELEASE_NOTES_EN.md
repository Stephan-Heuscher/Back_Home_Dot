# Release Notes - Assistive Tap

## Version 2.1.0 (2025-11-11)

### Safe-Home Mode as Default & Improved Color Picker

We are excited to announce **Assistive Tap v2.1.0**, which further enhances user experience with **Safe-Home as the default mode** and an **intuitive color picker**!

#### 🏠 Safe-Home Mode Now Default
- **Safety First**: Safe-Home is now the default mode for all users
- **Standard Mode Removed**: The old Standard mode has been removed from the UI (kept in code for backward compatibility)
- **Automatic Migration**: Users with the old Standard mode will be automatically migrated to Safe-Home
- **Simplified Selection**: Only two modes to choose from: Safe-Home (default) and Navi

#### 🎨 Improved Color Picker
- **HSV Instead of RGB**: Intuitive color selection with Hue, Saturation, and Brightness
- **Larger Preview**: 120dp tall color preview with elevation for better visibility
- **Better Labels**:
  - "Color Type" instead of "Red, Green, Blue"
  - "Color Intensity" for saturation
  - "Brightness" for value
- **Senior-Friendly**: No more technical RGB values
- **Real-Time Preview**: Color updates live as sliders are adjusted
- **Accessible Touch Targets**: All sliders with 48dp minimum height

#### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Changed `AppConstants.DEFAULT_TAP_BEHAVIOR` to "SAFE_HOME"
- `SettingsActivity` now uses `Color.HSVToColor()` and `Color.colorToHSV()`
- Completely redesigned `color_picker_dialog.xml` layout
- Removed Standard mode radio button from `activity_settings.xml`
- Added migration logic in SettingsActivity

#### 🎯 Benefits for Users
- **More Safety**: Default mode ensures users always return home
- **Easier Customization**: Color picker is more intuitive and visual
- **Less Confusion**: Fewer modes to choose from

## Version 2.0.0 (2025-11-05)

### Major Refactoring - Clean Architecture & Safe-Home Mode

We are excited to announce **Assistive Tap v2.0.0**, a complete architectural overhaul with the new **Safe-Home Mode** that significantly improves code quality, maintainability, and user experience!

#### 🏠 Safe-Home Mode (New!)
- **Always Home**: All taps lead to home screen - maximum safety for users who need simplicity
- **Square Design**: Button becomes a rounded square (8dp radius) - like Android navigation buttons
- **Protected Dragging**: Button can only be moved after 500ms long-press to prevent accidental movement
- **Minimal Drag Threshold**: Short drags trigger Home, substantial drags move the button
- **Mode-based Design**: Circle (Standard/Navi) vs. Square (Safe-Home)

#### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Component Extraction**: Extracted specialized components from monolithic OverlayService
  - **KeyboardManager** (273 lines): Complete keyboard avoidance management with debouncing
  - **PositionAnimator** (86 lines): Smooth position animations using ValueAnimator
  - **OrientationHandler** (97 lines): Mathematical rotation transformations for all orientations
- **Code Reduction**: OverlayService reduced from 670 to ~459 lines (31% reduction)
- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation between Domain, Data, and Presentation layers
- **Testability**: All components are now independently testable
- **Dependency Injection**: ServiceLocator pattern ready for Hilt migration

#### 🔄 Rotation Handling - Zero Jump
- **Hide During Rotation**: Dot is now hidden during screen rotation to eliminate visible jumping
- **Smart Detection**: Dynamic 16ms polling detects dimension changes immediately
- **Perfect Positioning**: Dot reappears at mathematically correct position after rotation
- **Mathematical Transformation**: Accurate center-point transformation for all rotation angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)

#### ⌨️ Keyboard Avoidance Improvements
- **Fully Extracted**: Complete keyboard management in dedicated KeyboardManager class
- **Smart Margin**: 1.5x dot diameter distance from keyboard
- **Debouncing**: Prevents position flickering during keyboard transitions
- **Snapshot/Restore**: Position memory for keyboard appearance/disappearance cycles

#### 🎨 User Experience
- **Eliminated Jumping**: Dot no longer jumps during rotation
- **Faster Response**: Intelligent detection provides optimal timing (~16ms on most devices)
- **Seamless Transitions**: All animations and position updates are smooth

#### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Repository Pattern**: Migrated BackHomeAccessibilityService to repository pattern
- **Reactive Data**: Kotlin Flows for real-time settings updates
- **Component Composition**: Composition over inheritance pattern throughout
- **ServiceLocator**: Factory methods for all specialized components

### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are internal architecture improvements

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed dot jumping during screen rotation
- Improved keyboard avoidance reliability
- Better position calculation accuracy

## Version 1.1.1 (2025-11-03)

### New Features

We are excited to announce **Assistive Tap v1.1.1** with major enhancements to accessibility, navigation customization, and user experience!

#### 🎯 Tap Behavior Modes
- **Two Behavior Options**: Choose between STANDARD and BACK tap behavior modes
- **STANDARD Mode** (recommended): 1 tap = Home, 2 taps = Back (intuitive Android navigation)
- **BACK Mode**: 1 tap = Back, 2 taps = Switch to previous app (traditional behavior)
- **Always Available**: 3 taps = All open apps, 4 taps = Open app, long press = Home screen

#### ⌨️ Keyboard Avoidance
- **Automatic Positioning**: Floating dot automatically moves up when keyboard appears
- **Smart Detection**: Detects keyboard visibility and adjusts position accordingly
- **Seamless Experience**: No manual repositioning needed when typing

#### 🎨 Dynamic User Interface
- **Context-Aware Instructions**: Main screen instructions automatically update based on selected tap behavior
- **Settings Optimization**: Tap behavior selection moved to top of settings for better discoverability
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Updated strings and descriptions for improved usability

#### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Automatic Versioning**: Release builds now automatically increment version numbers
- **Build Process Enhancement**: Version code and patch version increment automatically for each release
- **Improved Build Scripts**: Gradle build process optimized with dynamic versioning

### Changes

#### ✅ Enhanced Features
- **Tap Behavior Selection**: Radio buttons in settings for easy mode switching
- **Real-time Instructions**: Main screen text updates immediately when behavior changes
- **Settings Reorganization**: Most important setting (tap behavior) moved to top
- **Keyboard Avoidance**: Automatic dot repositioning when typing

#### ✅ Technical Updates
- **Version Properties**: New `version.properties` file for automatic version management
- **Build Automation**: Release builds automatically increment version numbers
- **Documentation Updates**: README and technical docs updated to reflect changes
